		Iâ€™m primarily a visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I care deeply about diversity and inclusivity in tech and frequently speak at events across the world. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.

		Letâ€™s make great things together!
