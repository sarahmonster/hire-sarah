An experimental project, designed to vastly simplify and streamline the WordPress site-building process for small business owners by using technology to automate design decisions. In addition to conducting extensive user research with small businesses, I also led this project from a design, product, and vision perspective as it morphed across two different teams and different projects.

Design patterns, approaches, and Rivet's API are now being implemented in the WordPress mobile app, in WordPress.com signup, and in third-party importers.
