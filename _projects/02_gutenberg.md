Gutenberg is the codename for the new WordPress editor, a large-scale open-source undertaking. In addition to working on various UI improvements, I coordinated designers to undertake a full audit of all the individual blocks that make up the editor, with an eye toward usability, accessibility, and consistency across the experience.

As the editor expands to encompass the entire site-building experience, I’m developing a research framework & toolkit to encourage and facilitate user research throughout the open-source community. Currently I’m leading a round of exploratory research to better understand users’ mental models and conceptions around building a site.
