Pique is a WordPress.com theme I designed and developed, now in use on over 600,000 user sites.

I started development by researching patterns used real websites, focussed on coffeeshops as a specific niche, then worked around the technical constraints of WordPress in innnovative ways to build a theme that established new patterns. These patterns were then refined and reused by a number of different themes that followed, including the default Twenty Nineteen theme for that year.
