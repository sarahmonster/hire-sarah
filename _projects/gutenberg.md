Gutenberg is the codename for the new WordPress editor, a large-scale open-source undertaking. In addition to working on various UI improvements, 

As the editor expands to encompass the entire site-building experience, I’m developing a research framework & toolkit to encourage and facilitate user research throughout the open-source community. Currently I’m leading a round of exploratory research to better understand users’ mental models and conceptions around building a site.


Other Gutenberg work:

- I coordinated designers to undertake a [full audit of all the individual blocks](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/19) that make up the editor, with an eye toward usability, accessibility, and consistency across the experience.
- worked on improvements to the [publishing flow](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/7602)
- worked on component documentation based on the Material design system
