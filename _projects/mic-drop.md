  metadata="Introduction"
  heading="The challenge"
  content="I've almost always been a remote worker. But COVID meant that lots of people suddenly got unexpectedly thrust into remote working, and there were some real problems with people's meetings getting interrupted.
  
  I designed a macOS app to combat this problem. Mic Drop allows you to control your system mute state with a keyboard shortcut or menubar control. It shows your current mute state in your menubar, an optional floating status window, or a number of different notifications."

  heading="Helping users know they’re muted"
  content="Our primary goal with Mic Drop is to ensure users feel confident in their mute state, which can be challenging given we’re not the only app interacting with the microphone.

  To meet this goal, I designed the Mic Check feature, a floating window that users can resize and move around their screen. It can show an optional VU meter that responds to the user’s input, so a user can see if the noises they’re making are being heard.

  I also included both visual and audible notifications any time the mute state is toggled."

  metadata="UX Writing"
  heading="Simplifying complexity"
  content="Many of our users are quite technical, and often request technical features. These are sometimes valid to include, but complex to show in an interface we want to remain friendly.

  I’m continually adapting and adjusting the settings screens to ensure things remain simple and as straightforward as possible. I put a great deal of focus on copyediting."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="Onboarding"
  heading="Getting off on the right foot"
  content="One tricky thing with a menubar app is that menubar icons often run off the screen and disappear. This can prompt users to think the app is broken, when really, they just need an overflow menu provided by a third-party app.
  
  To combat any confusion, I built a prompt into the one-page onboarding process that helps users find the menubar icon, and directing them to a help page that gives more information."

  metadata="Marketing"
  heading="Wearing all the hats"
  content="Mic Drop launched in early 2020, around the same time COVID hit and everyone started working remotely. We didn’t exactly plan it this way, but tried to make the best of an odd situation.
  
  As a small two-person operation, I wound up taking on a whole range of different tasks. In addition to spearheading all of the UX and UI design, I was also primarily responsible for steering marketing efforts and ensuring they were done effectively but with sensitivity. I adopted a grassroots approach and Mic Drop has primarily been successful via word-of-mouth."

  metadata="Research"
  heading="Listening to users"
  content="We encourage users to write in with feedback, which we compile and track. People tend to write in with solutions, and it’s part of my job to reverse-engineer that to figure out what their actual problem is.

  After a few years of listening to users and collecting feedback, we launched Mic Drop 2.0 with a whole slew of new features and improvements rooted in user feedback."

  metadata="Outcomes"
  heading="What did I accomplish?"
  content="Mic Drop was featured at various times by both MacRumors and Apple. We've sold thousands of copies and maintain a 4+ star rating on the App Store.
  
  People rely on Mic Drop to keep them quiet during meetings, podcasts, and even online magic shows. (!!) In the four years since it was released, we’ve heard from hundreds of users who tell us how much they love Mic Drop and how indispensible it is in their daily lives."
