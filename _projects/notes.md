 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**, so I know how to work with engineering teams in order to ensure the best possible output. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

 **I'm passionate about my work but aim to keep my ego out of it.** Exploring and then iterating is a key part of my process, and I'm comfortable throwing something away when it isn't working. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.

My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven, organised, and focused on results. My experience working directly with clients means I'm great at planning projects and ensuring they're delivered according to schedule.

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I always approach my work mobile first and am great at simplifying complex interactions and interfaces. I have extensive experience with Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma, and other design tools, as well as front-end development experience and experience working with and developing design systems. 

 **I'm passionate about my work but aim to keep my ego out of it.** I love iterating on work based on feedback, but I'm comfortable pushing back when it's called for, and I'm good at justifying my design decisions. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
