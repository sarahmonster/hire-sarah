## Challenge

Building a website from scratch is a challenge for small businesses, who often lack the resources to do it themselves. We wanted to make it as easy as possible to get up and running with a simple one-page website that would meeet their needs.

## Research

I kicked off the project with some exploratory user research, talking to small business owners to get a better understanding of their needs and pain points as they relate to websites. A key finding was that they had no real interest in the process of building a site, but didn't have the budget to hire someone to take it on.

I also conducted competitive research to benchmark competitors and upstarts in this space.

## Ideation

Here you should provide answers on following questions: How did you solve the problem? Why did you choose that particular solution, and what influenced your decision?

## Design 

It’s essential to describes how you went from insights to conception, to solution and and impact. Show wireframes, Lo/Hi fidelity mockups, and working prototypes. Employers need to know that you can do these, and can think through the detail that a developer will need. If possible, add an interactive prototype (such as inVision) to allow reviewers to play with it.

## Testing

Testing was conducted iteratively throughout the process, both to test the effectiveness of the final site and to test the interface itself. Testing comprised a short interview, followed by a usability test, and then some follow-up questions, both qualitative and quanititative.

Key metrics to judge our success included: time to build a site, rating of ease of building site, and rating of overall value of final site.


In addition to conducting extensive user research with small businesses, I also led this project from a design, product, and vision perspective as it morphed across two different teams and different projects.

Design patterns, approaches, and Rivet's API are now being implemented in the WordPress mobile app, in WordPress.com signup, and in third-party importers.
