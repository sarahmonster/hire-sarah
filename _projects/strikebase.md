## Challenge

My team was juggling multiple projects with different clients and tracking all the data in a series of convoluted and disconnected spreadsheets and web apps. We needed a way to better manage all this data and to be able to see it all in one place.

## Research

I started by conducting casual interviews with my team, asking them to describe their workdays, talk through their typical process, and identify any pain points. This data was used to inform user stories and determine product direction.

## Ideation

I sketched out some quick user stories to better understand how the product might solve our problems in the context we'd most need it.

<div class="portfolio-sequence">
	<figure>
		<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/img_0952.jpg" />
		<figcaption>I want to find out if we have any contacts at Black Girls Code, or if we’ve done any work for similar organisations. I’m on my tablet—I was reading in bed and suddenly thought about looking up any contacts we might have.</figcaption>
	</figure>

		<figcaption>Krutal just had a meeting with a new contact and wants to enter their information in before he forgets it. He’s in his car on his phone. (Not driving though, obviously.)</figcaption>
	</figure>

		<figcaption>Christie wants to find out who’s due for a check-in and mark them as checked-in. She’s on her laptop in her normal working-space, wherever that may be.</figcaption>
	</figure>

		<figcaption>Michelle wants to enlist someone with JS skills to work on a project. She’s on her laptop at home.</figcaption>
	</figure>

		<figcaption>Dan is bored and looking for a new project to work on. He’s in line at the grocery store and idly browsing his phone.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>


## Design 

Wireframes for the app's functionality came from the user stories.

<div class="portfolio-sequence">
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/wire_4.jpg" class="double-size" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/wire_2.jpg" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/wire_1.jpg" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/wire_3.jpg" />
</div>

As we progressed further, I managed project milestones, guided development, and kept a close eye on scope creep. At each stage in the design process, I checked in with the team to ensure the app would be best meeting their needs, and I conducted monthly check-ins to ensure we were on schedule to deliver within our anticipated timeframe in spite of ongoing client commitments.

Higher fidelity mockups, tuned for smaller devices first, were next, along with a design language developed via a branding exercise I facilitated with the team. I put together a [simple prototype](https://marvelapp.com/2idcafh) to better illustrate the flow of the pieces.

<div class="portfolio-sequence">
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/people.png" class="double-size" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/projects.png" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/dashboard.png" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/person.png" />
	<img src="/assets/img/strikebase/project.png" />
</div>

Count Chocula and Pippi Longstocking often make an appearance in my mockups.
