  metadata="Introduction"
  heading="The challenge"
  content="WordPress is the world's most popular content management system, powering over 33% of websites. Unfortunately, for much of the project's history, many product decisions were made without any real contact with end users. Product decisions have been driven by the needs of the WordPress core community, who represent a very small (and rather biased) slice of WordPress’ userbase.

  For phase two of the Gutenberg project, in which the new WordPress post editor expands to encompass more of the site building experience, we wanted to change all that.

  I designed and lead an exploratory research study to better understand how users think about building a site."

  metadata="Kickoff"
  heading="Stakeholder interviews"
  content="To kick off the project, I started with a series of stakeholder interviews. I interviewed a variety of people, from project leads to community plugin developers, to inform the scope and goals of the research.

  I then used post-it notes to cluster the insights in different groupings. The insights gathered at this stage helped inform the goals of the research and how we’d share results, as well as providing historical context and increasing stakeholder participation in the process."

  metadata="Project planning"
  heading="Making a plan (or two)"
  content="I gathered requirements and developed an overall project plan. This work was done publicly and [shared with the open-source community](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2018/11/30/exploring-sitebuilding-via-user-research/).

  I led a small team to collaborate on a shorter [one-page project plan](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-plan-one-page--AhRQim57HfXOpnhcYQtqlkvzAg-ofalotl7MM3VPpcmnOPZw) and a longer, [more detailed plan](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-plan-detailed--AhSVJNxxYCwaLoC49U2ITtmYAg-TrKz1a20z5Z4lt7xdPlwD).

  This clarified the project goals, timeline, methodology, target participants, and deliverables, as well as ensuring that our understanding of the requirements was correct and everyone was on the same page."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="Privacy concerns"
  heading="Keeping safe in open source"
  content="The nature of open-source demands that work be transparent and open to outside contributions. This was a bit of a challenge for user research, where researchers invariably have access to private user information.

  I knew from the outset that I wanted to be able to include members of the general public in the research process, but I wanted to be very certain we were considerate of user privacy. I liased with a lawyer to craft legally-binding agreements for both participants and researchers, ensuring we had a legal framework to cover any potential issues."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="Preparation"
  heading="Making a list, checking it twice"
  content="I facilitated an open session to learn questions that designers and developers working on the project had regarding the site building process. These questions then formed the backbone for the interview script.

  I worked with a contract recruiter to find participants according to my criteria established in the research plan.

  I also made a lot of to-do lists to make sure that all tasks were taken care of before we started the sessions, and I invited the community to [participate as researchers](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2018/12/09/how-to-participate-in-user-research/), along with preparing guides for each different role."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="User interviews"
  heading="Making new friends"
  content="Since our researchers were new to the research process, I created guides for each individual role (moderator, note-taker, and observer) and mentored new researchers in their roles.

  All sessions were run remotely with a private Slack channel for researchers to share questions and notes.


  Sessions involved a preliminary interview, followed by an experimental session where we looked over their shoulder as they worked on their own websites, followed by more follow-up conversations.

  We loosely followed an [interview script](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Session-script--Ahbzc3lH25_dQPeYKkEzE_G9Ag-OLcRgsqxAvILvMpOhgfiL), but since it was exploratory, the sessions often led down divergent paths."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="Data synthesis"
  heading="Trying to make sense of it all"
  content="Once we'd finished talking to 17 users, we had a whole lot of data to sift through. I lead the more community researchers in the analysis.

  To coordinate the [synthesis of data](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-synthesis-plan-of-attack--AhRBMJ6bHU2AIWTVQmw8BodgAg-ujM9Z3MS42quQyv0FP33M), I created a [database to code notes & observations](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invgIkmtbjmxHSynX&inviteToken=00f6685b5b2a2934ad87a61af6638723c95f08d38f8e2e350f0df2b33d784df2) in a structured way. I assigned each researcher to a session, which they were responsible for encoding. Researchers pulled out: stories and quotes; tasks, motivations, emotions, drives; insights and pain points.

  Once the data was encoded, I configured different views to start looking for patterns. I discovered behaviour-based segmentation groups in the data and split it that way, then focussed on determining patterns across the segments."

{% include portfolio-panel.md
  metadata="Presenting results"
  heading="Making pretty graphs"
  content="Next up: we had to turn all that data into usable feedback!

  For each identified segment, I presented an overview, key takeaways, goals, pain points, a user journey map, and opportunities. Separately, I included a broader summary with key findings, an analysis of recurring themes, and product recommendations.

  The [report](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/01/31/sitebuilding-research-background/) was published as a five-part series, followed by an [interactive walkthrough and Q&A session](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2019/03/27/site-building-research-walkthrough/)."

  metadata="Outcomes"
  heading="What did I accomplish?"
  content="  I led and mentored a team of 25 researchers, many of whom were new to research. In addition to learning a great deal about real users' behaviours and expectations, I generated community interest in participating in and conducting research efforts.

  Results from the study are used to inform product decisions across the WordPress project, and to form a foundation for further user research.

  To further empower the community, I’ve been developing an open-source research framework & toolkit, comprising of a series of guides and
  templates, a platform for easy testing, a pre-recruited database of warm leads from which to recruit, and a database of insights gleaned from
  previous research."
