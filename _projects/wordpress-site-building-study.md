  content="WordPress is the world's most popular content management system, powering over 33% of websites. Unfortunately, for much of the project's history, many product decisions were made without any real contact with end users. Product decisions have been driven by the needs of the WordPress core community, who represent a very small (and rather biased) slice of WordPressâ€™ userbase.

  For phase two of the Gutenberg project, in which the new WordPress post editor expands to encompass more of the site building experience, we wanted to change all that.

  I designed and lead an exploratory research study to better understand how users think about building a site."

  heading="Project planning"
  content="I gathered requirements and developed an overall project plan. This work was done publicly and [shared with the open-source community](https://make.wordpress.org/design/2018/11/30/exploring-sitebuilding-via-user-research/).

  I led a small team to collaborate on a shorter [one-page project plan](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-plan-one-page--AhRQim57HfXOpnhcYQtqlkvzAg-ofalotl7MM3VPpcmnOPZw) and a longer, [more detailed plan](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Research-plan-detailed--AhSVJNxxYCwaLoC49U2ITtmYAg-TrKz1a20z5Z4lt7xdPlwD).

  This clarified the project goals, timeline, methodology, target participants, and deliverables, as well as ensuring that our understanding of the requirements was correct and everyone was on the same page."
