company: Bakpax
title: Hello Bakpax! Let's work together.

whyyou: |
 Education is a passion of mine: I've done a lot of teaching, mentoring, and speaking, and I'm always teaching myself something new. I'd be thrilled to help **teachers and students use their time more effectively**.

 I'm also passionate about applying emerging technologies to **solve real problems** in areas that don't get as much attention from technological innovation and disruption. I'm excited that Bakpax is addressing an underserved and important market. I think this is an opportunity to affect real change and have an impact, and **I'd love to be a part of it**.

whyme: |

 I have over ten years of experience, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from visual and web design, to user experience, to product management. My experience working remotely means I'm a great communicator, and my experience leading projects means I'm self motivated and have a strong sense of **agency and ownership** over my work. I've launched a variety of different consumer-facing products and features, and I especially relish planning, designing, managing, and building a new product from scratch.

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I'm experienced in both quantitative and qualitative research methods and I'm comfortable planning and leading research studies.

 My background in visual design means I'm well-versed in **aesthetics and UI design**. I'm a perfectionist at heart, but I refuse to let perfect be the enemy of great, and I'm a big fan of making iterative improvements.

You want to work with a team of people who get it. They’ve got a great product strategy and also a great go-to-market strategy. They’ve got deep experience, but they’re more excited than ever about making things. You want to work with people who are humble, but confident in what they’re doing and driven to do it well. You communicate clearly, succinctly, and amiably, and value others who do likewise. You reflect and learn from your successes and failures. You’re not afraid of failure, because sometimes it’s the only way to get better, and you’re not afraid to do what it takes to get better. You want to work with incredible engineers — who don’t need to “put their product hats on” because they’re always thinking about the product. You listen and you watch. You put yourself in the position of others.

You crave a work environment where you can be a whole person. You want time and flexibility to be yourself: to go on a walk, take care of a loved on, go to the doctor, and feel supported by your coworkers. And you want to support them so that they can live good lives too.

You are awesome at what you do and you could work anywhere. But maybe you’ve come to realize that you only have so many years on this earth to leave your mark. And where better to leave it than in education? Education determines the flow rate of human progress in all endeavors. It’s the ultimate Archimedes’ lever.

If you’re reading this and considering this job, we can assume you are incredibly, incredibly lucky, because it means you have marketable skills that pay very well. You have a career you love. You can decide where you want to work. And you want to work somewhere that matters.

Come work with us.

------------------------------------

Bakpax uses AI to read handwriting and auto-grade assignments. We save teachers the time and trouble of grading, and give students instant feedback to increase their engagement and help them study. We can convert teachers’ handwritten content to formatted digital text that can be remixed and shared with other teachers’.

We are seeking a senior User Experience/Product Manager to join our team. At larger companies, Product Management and User Experience are two separate roles. But we need you to excel at both. Though we’re growing nicely and seeing strong user engagement, we are still a small team and we wear multiple hats.

------------------------------------



We are currently accepting for candidates from all countries in the timezones PST (UTC-8) to BRT (UTC-3).

Job Requirements:
* A desire to help teachers teach and students learn
* Excellent written and verbal communication
* Strong sense of agency & ownership
* Knowledge of qualitative and quantitative research methods
* Experience launching multiple direct-to-consumer products or features
* 5+ years product management or product design or user experience design experience
* Pragmatism — pixel perfect begins with a mess and some user complaints

Nice to haves:
* Worked for a very early stage startup (you know how to get things going from scratch).
* Eye for design
* UI Experience
* Worked in education

More about the job:
* Money - we will pay you
* Equity - it’s early stage so it’s a good amount
* Remote - we work remotely. This is nice, and, like anything, has its drawbacks. We’re committed to helping each other work remotely while building a strong culture. We get together in person from time to time to have fun together, hone our skills and strategies, and plan.
* Healthcare - our government does not provide it, so we will.
* Be a hero to your teacher family members & friends - Seriously. If we can build this it will really be helpful.
