title: Hello Basalt! Let's build design systems together.

whyyou: |

 I love, love, _love_ how into design systems you are, and how you're running with that and focussing on that passion. My main side project right now is an [open-source design system](https://nautilus.octopusthink.com). It's been quite satisfying codifying and clarifying all of my design decisions, rather than picking numbers and colours out of a hat!

 I'm a big believer in component-driven design and design systems, and I'd love to develop more subject area expertise. I'm also a big believer in the efficiency and power of open source (I'm currently working on the WordPress project) and I'm especially interested in working on tooling to help designers & developers, so I'd love to contribute to Knapsack.

 I firmly believe that **design isn't just about how it looks**. Although I have a background in visual design, my years of experience has taught me that the fundamentals of design are much more complex than how things look. Finally, I like that you're a small team but work on a lot of different projects. Beyond being a designer: I'm a copyeditor, a (reluctant) developer, a user-researcher, and moreâ€”I'm happiest when I'm able to contribute all of my skills to a project.

 In short: I think we'd make a great fit!

whyme: |
  I have **over ten years of visual and product design experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. I have a strong technical background that allows me to work with development teams.

  This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**, and I'm a natural leader who has experience leading other designers on project work.

  I have a particular interest in **design systems and component-driven design**. I'm currently building an open-source design system and component library as well as contributing to component work in WordPress. I use Sketch, Figma, and InVision on a daily basis.

  My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as guiding feedback into actionable tasks. I'm very comfortable leading teams and sharing my knowledge, whether that's via speaking at conferences, leading contribution days, or running workshops.

  Having spent eight years freelancing, I'm extremely **proactive and self-motivated**. There is very little I can't figure out how to do, and I like getting things done. I'm always experimenting and learning more. (On my plate lately: data visualisation and machine learning!)
