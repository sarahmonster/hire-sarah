title: Hello Brightside! Let's make the world a little brighter, together.

whyyou: |
 I believe technology can be a driving force for good in the world if it's applied to **solving real problems**. As someone who's been personally affected by depression, this is a problem I'd really love to see solved. 

 I think it could make a huge impact for millions of people. I'd be thrilled to be a part of that.

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven, organised, and focused on results. My experience working directly with clients means I'm great at planning projects and ensuring they're delivered according to schedule.

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I always approach my work mobile first and am great at simplifying complex interactions and interfaces. I have extensive experience with Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma, and other design tools, as well as front-end development experience and experience working with and developing design systems. 

 **I'm passionate about my work but aim to keep my ego out of it.** I love iterating on work based on feedback, but I'm comfortable pushing back when it's called for, and I'm good at justifying my design decisions. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.

- Have a creative and informed POV, but also want to use it to extend and enhance a brand system
- Mobile first
