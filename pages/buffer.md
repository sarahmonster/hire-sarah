title: Hello Buffer! Let's work together.
intro: I've always been a fan of Buffer's commitment to transparency, fairness, and openness, and I've been waiting for the right position to open up. Whilst I'm a designer at heart, I feel like product management would be a natural evolution for me, and would help put my range of skills and experience to good use. I'd especially love to focus on the core of Buffer's product.
