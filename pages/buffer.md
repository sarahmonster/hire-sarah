title: Hello Buffer! Let's work together.
jobtitle: Product Manager
company: Buffer

whyyou: I've always been a fan of Buffer's commitment to transparency, fairness, and openness, and I've been waiting for the right position to open up. Whilst I'm a designer at heart, I feel like product management would be a natural evolution for me, and would help put my range of skills and experience to good use. I'd especially love to focus on the core of Buffer's product.

whyme: Iâ€™m primarily a visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I care deeply about diversity and inclusivity in tech and frequently speak at events across the world. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
