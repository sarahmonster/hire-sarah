whyyou: |

  While my background includes both visual and experience design and I care deeply about both, I like to start with the overall experience, and I believe the **design is more than just how it looks**.

  I'm also a big fan of using computers to automate repetitive tasks, so that humans can focus on what humans do best. Creating relevant, contextual, and timely messaging that helps both users _and_ the companies sending those messages sounds like an interesting challenge. I'd love to contribute to a more **empathetic approach to automated messaging**.

  Finally, I like that you're a small, close-knit team, and I love that you're baking **inclusion and accessibility** into your design system. And, not going to lie, I dig that you include "awkwardness" as one of your values, alongside the more serious ones. There's definitely value in embracing one's inner weirdo. ðŸ˜œ

  In short: I think we'd make a great fit!

  I have **over ten years of visual and product design experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. I have a strong technical background that allows me to work with development teams (I'm really good with **HTML, CSS, and git**, and I'm not afraid to dive into some JavaScript while I'm there!)

  This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**. This means I have experience with **copyediting, illustration, and visual design** and care deeply about typography and layout, but my first and foremost concern is with **how it works**, because no amount of visual polish will resolve a poor user experience!

  I am extremely interested in **finding ways to improve the user experience of complex flows and features**. I care deeply about user needs and often advocate for the voice of the user, encouraging the designers I work with to think not in terms of features but in terms of how the product can solve a user need. I have extensive experience with both **exploratory user research and usability testing**, having led studies with teams of twenty-five designers in the open source WordPress space.

  My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **presenting and defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as guiding feedback into actionable tasks. I'm very comfortable leading teams and sharing my knowledge, whether that's via speaking at conferences, leading contribution days, or running workshops. I'm always learning new skills and looking for ways to improve processes and be more efficient, and I'm not afraid of challenge or innovation!
