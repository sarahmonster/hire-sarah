title: Hello digitalCounsels! Let's make legal services better, together.

whyyou: |

 It may sound a bit idealistic, but I'm a big believer in the **power of technology as a tool to improve people's lives**. I'm also a big fan of openness and transparency, so I'm really compelled by the work you're doing to make legal services more accessible and comprehensible to people. I think it can make a big difference to both individuals and legal professionals to have this sort of service, and I'd love to be a part of it!

 I'm also looking for an opportunity to work with a small team and wear a lot of hats. I do best when I can contribute in a variety of different ways and I love working closely with development teams.

 In short: I think we'd make a great fit!

whyme: |
  I have **over ten years of design and UX experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**.

  Iâ€™m primarily a **visual and product designer**, but I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skilfully with development teams. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, Sass HTML, JavaScript, and React.** I'm extremely comfortable implementing designs, contributing to rapid prototyping, or hacking together ideas in order to test a solution.

  I tend to lean toward **clean design with great typography**. I use industry-standard tools (Sketch, InVision, Figma, etc) and have experience with both high- and low-fidelity wireframes, prototypes, and mockups in order to communicate a design concept.

  My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as dealing with a range of different types of companies and organisations and navigating the complexities of coordinating work across timezones. Having spent eight years freelancing, I'm **independent, careful, and organised**, and I love solving big problems.
