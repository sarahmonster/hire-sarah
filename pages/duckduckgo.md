 Technology is a tool that can be leveraged to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But as technology pays more and more attention to what we're doing, that data serves to benefit corporations, not people. I believe that individuals need to be able to manage their privacy online in order to be the beneficiaries of technology, and that **privacy is a right that everyone, regardless of technical ability, should be able to access**.

 **Transparency** is something I value highly, and I love working with people who are passionate about their work and their purpose. I'm a big fan of constructive criticism and would love to work with a team who'll challenge me to do my best work. Oh, and I love that you make yearly donations to organisations you think are worthwhile, and that you included Girl Develop It and Freedom of the Press Foundation amongst the recipients.

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely, both with clients and in an open-source context, means I have great written communication skills and can clearly articulate design decisions. My experience leading projects allows me to approach work in a strategic way, defining the vision, roadmap, and success metrics of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I have extensive experience with Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma, Abstract and other design tools, as well as front-end development experience. I approach my work with a mobile-first perspective and have experience adapting designs for different devices. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

 My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.

We are a diverse team from around the world, working together with a shared vision to raise the standard of trust online. Join our team as a Senior Visual Designer who is up for the challenge to lead and transform the DuckDuckGo experience across all of our products. 

As part of our small but growing design team, you will be collaborating with team members at all levels to challenge and define the visual language used throughout our search engine and privacy tools. You will be involved in the entire design process, from ideation to execution. You will have a voice in all product decisions, both big and small. 

We are fully remote and seek to empower our team to be self-directed and self-motivated in their projects. If that seems awesome and you like the idea of our core values -- build trust, question assumptions, and validate direction -- you'll fit right in!

 

What you will do:

    Evolve our current visual design style and execute pixel-perfect designs that solve challenging problems for our users
    Own your design process, communicating your plan and choices supported by mock-ups and prototypes
    Represent the design team when partnering with engineers to explore and execute new features and products
    Manage projects from scoping through implementation while communicating updates to our remote team

 

What we are looking for:

    You have a proven track record with 7+ years of related product design experience which is demonstrated by an exceptional portfolio of distinctive work that shows your high standard of craft and ability solve challenging problems
    You are creative and adventurous with your craft and can challenge our visual style, creating mock-ups that push our current way of thinking
    You are proficient in current design tools (e.g., Sketch, Abstract, InVision, Adobe creative suite) and use them to communicate ideas with your team and test with users
    You’re able to adapt designs across a variety of platforms and devices, and understand their opportunities and limitations
    You have a general understanding of front-end development and implementation
    You have excellent communication skills and can clearly articulate design decisions
    You think at a high level about creative strategy and vision, but can also execute based on provided direction
    You are able to use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to validate design decisions
    You have an eagerness to be transparent with your work, welcoming and navigating critique with colleagues
    You have proven project management experience, such as contributing towards project plans and defining requirements

 

Other things to know:

    We are a small, remote team in different time zones and communicate with a variety of tools throughout the day. Ideally, you will feel comfortable with the intricacies of this type of work situation.
    Sometimes we meet up! You can expect to travel at least 2x a year: once for our all-hands meetup and another for a team retreat ( Each ~5 days)
    We want to have a major impact on raising the standard of trust online. To do this we believe in a focused approach, and work on a single top priority at a time.
    Our work philosophy is built upon empowered project management. Anyone and everyone can (and should) ask questions and offer feedback around the product and internal projects. 
    We are open to sharing ideas and challenging the status quo regardless of your internal role. We encourage you to participate in areas of interest throughout the company. 
    We try to exemplify our values (build trust, question assumptions, and validate direction) in everything we do, and hope you will too!
