title: Hello Farmstead! Let's make great things together.

whyyou: |

 I love applying new technologies to **solve real problems**, and I think Farmstead is working to solve an interesting problem in a traditionally underlooked space. 

 I'd love to **drive Farmstead's visual identity** and ensure that it's usable, consistent, and pleasant across all of its experiences. I have a wide range of skills and relish working on a variety of challenges, so this sounds like it'd be a great fit.

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |
 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**, so I know how to work with engineering teams in order to ensure the best possible output. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

 **I'm passionate about my work but aim to keep my ego out of it.** Exploring and then iterating is a key part of my process, and I'm comfortable throwing something away when it isn't working. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.

Farmstead is a new digital grocer that sources and delivers fresh, local food to customers in 60 minutes or less. With micro-hubs in the Bay Area that carry only carefully curated, quality products, we leverage AI to aggressively optimize our supply chain and reduce food waste costs, while also helping customers order just what they will actually consume. We've been growing seasonally at 20-25% MoM, and have fulfillment partnerships with Postmates. We're a VC-backed, YC-backed startup that's taking on a $800B space with very low online adoption.

As our first full-time visual designer, you’ll play a key part in shaping Farmstead’s visual identity. We expect you to work closely with the rest of the product team owning visual design across our digital products and offline experiences -- we’re looking for a designer who has a broad set of skills and is comfortable working cross-functionally with all members of our team.

Since you will be the first member of our design team, you will have massive ownership of aesthetics and visuals across both our consumer digital products, operations products and offline experiences for customers. Lots of leverage, lots of responsibility. At the same time, you will NOT have a team of existing designers initially to provide day-to-day critique, so you will need to be comfortable shipping by yourself.

Over time, if you're the right person for it, you will be tasked with building the core design team.

Requirements

    Work with our existing product and engineering team to help create the best possible user experiences across desktop and mobile digital interfaces
    As part of the product team, help define flows, prototypes and high-fidelity mocks for new Farmstead features and share your work quickly and often
    Work closely with engineering to make sure your ideas are executed correctly down to the pixel, across all devices
    Help shape design culture and guidelines as the company grows since you’ll be the first member of the design team
