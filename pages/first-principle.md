company: First Principle
title: Hello First Principle! Let's work together.

whyyou: I'm passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to **solve real problems for people**. I'm excited by First Principle's collaborative and explorative approach to work. I'd like to work with a small team where I can learn a lot, explore new ideas, and collaborate whilst being self-driven. I think we'd make a great fit.

whyme: |
 I love wearing a lot of hats and **defining a product from the big picture to the tiny details**. I've worked remotely for over ten years and am super comfortable communicating asynchronously. Having run a freelance business for eight years, I'm extremely comfortable managing projects, meeting deadlines, and communicating with clients. 

 Iâ€™m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. Among other things, I have extensive experience with wireframing, visual design, research, and interaction design, as well as experience building design systems from scratch.

 **I'm passionate about my work but aim to keep my ego out of it.** Exploring and then iterating is a key part of my process, and I'm comfortable throwing something away when it isn't working. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
