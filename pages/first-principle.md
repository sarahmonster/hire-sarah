jobtitle: Product Designer
company: First Principle
title: Hello First Principle! Let's work together.

whyyou: I'm looking to work with a small team shipping great products. Emerging technologies, and design for emerging technologies, has been a passion of mine and is something I'd like to pursue further with a smaller, passionate team focussed on developing new products.

whyme: I love wearing a lot of hats and guiding a product from the big picture to the tiny details. Having run a freelance business for eight years, I'm extremely comfortable managing projects and communicating with clients. Iâ€™m primarily a visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
