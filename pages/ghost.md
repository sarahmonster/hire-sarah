title: Hello Ghost! Let's make great things together.

whyyou: |

 I've spent a lot of time working in open-source and it's now my default when it comes to making software. I embrace **transparency and openness** in my work and I love that Ghost shares those values, whilst working toward making the world a fairer and more accessible place.

 Most of my recent work has been leaning more toward UX, but I definitely miss the more visual side of things, and I've found myself really missing the visual side of design. I especially love typography, illustrations, and communicating complex concepts via simplified diagrams. Most of all, I love variations and it seems like this would be a good opportunity to work on a range of varied projects and applications, which is definitely my jam.

 I'd love to be able to help you work on solving challenging problems, improve Ghost for your existing users, and bring Ghost's power and simplicity to even more people.

 I think we'd make a great fit.

whyme: |

 I have **over ten years of design and UX experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**.

 My background in visual design means I'm well-versed in **aesthetics and UI design**. I have experience with branding and illustration as well as communication design, and I love working to define a design system and visual style across a product. I'm especially interested in designing and applying design systems and principles, and I really do believe that aesthetics are an important component of usability.

 I‚Äôm primarily a **visual and product designer**, but I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skillfully with development teams. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React.** I'm extremely comfortable implementing designs, contributing to rapid prototyping, or hacking together ideas in order to test a solution.

 My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as dealing with a range of different types of companies and organisations and navigating the complexities of coordinating work across timezones.

 Having spent eight years freelancing, I'm extremely **independent and autonomous**. I am happiest when I can design my own process for reaching a solution, and I tend toward ideating, iterating, prototyping, testing, and delivering designs without needing help or oversight.

 On the flip side, I do really love collaborating with others.  My experience working in an open source environment means that I'm adept at **defending my design decisions in a diplomatic way, but I'm never dogmatic** and I'm happy to be proven wrong. I'm not afraid of failure and I like to share my work as soon as possible for best results.

 I'm happy to learn when there's a better way of solving a problem, and I strongly believe that constructive criticism makes everyone's work better.

    ‚ö°Ô∏è Working with design and marketing leadership to define, evolve, and maintain Ghost's brand identity across all marketing and product touch points.

    üé® Creation of websites, landing pages, diagrams, illustrations, stickers, tshirts, checkout flows, billing management. You'll lead all of our most public facing properties and brand assets. The visual voice of the company.

    üöÄ You'll work with the marketing/business team on projects which are directly related to growing the business and creating user-facing content.

    üíë Designers at Ghost work on different cross-functional teams, there's still plenty of collaboration and feedback between teammates to help and support each other throughout various projects.

    üëª Lots of freedom to take control of your process, iterating and learning what works (and what doesn't), and putting your work into production. There's a lot of opportunity for professional growth here, as the team expands.

    üì¢ Communicating effectively with stakeholders when presenting your work and clearly articulating your design rationale

    ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Managing multiple projects, while setting appropriate expectations and meeting realistic deadlines


We‚Äôre looking for someone who is:

    An underdog. We aren't hiring flashy designers from Fortune 500's here, we're looking for real human people who like to do great work. If you don't think you're good enough for this role, then you're probably exactly who we'd like to join the team. Please do apply!
    Fiercely independent. All teams at Ghost operate fairly autonomously, and all team members are responsible for helping make decisions about what needs to be done. You'll need to be comfortable ideating, prototyping, testing and delivering designs without someone standing over your shoulder telling you what to do.
    Meticulous about style. Despite frequent character assassination amongst UX professionals, aesthetic style matters a great deal. We don't A/B test 50 shades of blue here to determine what converts best, we care about making beautiful things which we love.
    Humble but opinionated. We like smart people who have lots of ideas, yet are happy to discard their former opinions whenever a better way of doing things presents itself.
    A clear communicator. Good design is good communication, and as a remote team which communicates almost exclusively through writing ‚Äî concise, written communication is absolutely essential to this role.
    An active collaborator. We look for people who actively want critical feedback on their work early and often, and who get a kick out of refining and pushing what they do as a collaborative process because it creates a better end result. No design heroes.
    Comfortable with code. Ghost is a software company, and everyone here codes in one way or another. You don't need to be an expert, but you do need to be actively open to learning and working with code to do design.
    Hungry for meaningful work, and space to do it. Almost all work at Ghost is complex and extremely challenging - but also deeply rewarding. We're not in the slightest bit fucking interested in what Design-Twitter thinks about... well, anything at all really. We're aggressively uncool.


This role would be particularly suited to someone with a background as a freelancer or at an agency, who is looking for more, that they aren't getting from doing client work. This is a role where you can help influence design over the long term, not just fulfil a temporary brief which needs to be delivered quickly.
