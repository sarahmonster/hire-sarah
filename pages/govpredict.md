title: Hello GovPredict! Let's work together.

whyyou: Not to come off as too idealistic, but I'm a big believer in the power of design and technology to change the world. Politics is an area that I'd be especially interested in exploring, helping make government more transparent and more effective. **I love solving thorny problems.** I think the work GovPredict is doing is very necessary, and I'd love to be a part of it. 

whyme: |

 I have extensive experience as a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. My technical knowledge also allows me to design solutions with an eye for practical implementation, making it simpler for developers to ship code. Among other things, I have extensive experience with wireframing, visual design, interaction design, user research, and competitive analysis as well as experience building design systems from scratch.

 I've worked remotely for over ten years on both large and small teams, so I'm **super comfortable communicating asynchronously** and my communication skills are well-honed.

 I'm a big believer in **making things happen**. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
