 It may sound a bit idealistic, but I'm a big believer in the **power of technology as a tool to improve people's lives**.

 As technology becomes more intertwined in our day-to-day lives, it's important that we're vigilant in ensuring that technology isn't threatening our well-being. HackerOne is making the internet a safer place for people, and I'd like to be a part of that.

 I really connected with your commitment towards **defaulting to disclosure**. I care deeply about openness and transparency, and I'm always prompting people I work with to default to public. Information empowers people, and sharing knowledge allows more people to discover their hacker mindset, leading to more innovative thinking.

 Oh, and I really like the pink used in your website. Let's not discount the pink.

  I have **over ten years of design and UX experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**.

  I’m primarily a **visual and product designer**, but I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skillfully with development teams. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React.** I'm extremely comfortable implementing designs, contributing to rapid prototyping, or hacking together ideas in order to test a solution.

  I've done a lot of user research and skilled at **planning and leading research studies**—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

  My experience in open-source work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders. Leading projects and organising work in the open-source space has honed my ability to organise, lead, and present ideas clearly. Most of this work tends to be written, but as a frequent conference speaker, I also have excellent presentation skills.
