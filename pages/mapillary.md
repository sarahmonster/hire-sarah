title: Hello Mapillary! Let's work together.

whyyou: |

 I believe that technology can be a **tool for positive change** in the world, and I'm passionate about applying the power of technology to solving real problems. As a frequent traveller, I spend a lot of time staring at maps. They're a fascinating way of representing the real world in a visual format, but maps are also incredibly defined by politics, both historically and in the present, and with impending technologies like self-driving vehicles, it becomes more important that we ensure they're as detailed and impartial as possible.

 I've spent a lot of time working in open-source and I love that Mapillary is leveraging the power of community to build its product. I tend toward **transparency and openness** in my work and I'd love to work with a company that shares those values, whilst working toward making the world a fairer and more accessible place.

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.
