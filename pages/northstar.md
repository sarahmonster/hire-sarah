title: Hello Northstar! Let's work together.

whyyou: |

 I'm looking to work with a small team where I can have a big impact. I'm hoping to work with people who care passionately about the product they're working on and can **challenge me when I don't have the best solution**. 

 Most of all, I like **solving real problems for people**. I'm excited that Northstar is working to democratize financial guidance for everyone, and I'd love to help bring financial assurance and security to more people. 

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

 My background in visual design means I'm well-versed in **aesthetics and UI design**. I have experience with branding and illustration as well as communication design, and I love working to define a design system and visual style across a product.

Northstar is a new kind of hybrid financial advisor — combining human financial experts with fully automated money movement. We guide you through key life events with Starter Packs that focus on the essential bank accounts. Then, each payday, Northstar calculates how much you can afford, and transfers the optimal amounts to pay off debt, save, pay bills, and invest. By combining the empathy of human advisors with the affordability of automation, Northstar democratizes the best financial guidance for everyone.

Northstar is a paid membership — you can sign up either as an individual or through your employer as a financial wellness benefit. We’re headquartered in SF, backed by top venture investors, and in market with paying customers.

We’re looking for the first non-founder designer to join our team. The design so far has been done by one of the co-founders, and this is a unique opportunity to join at the ground level.

As a designer, you’ll work on design challenges unique to Northstar, including:
• distilling large amounts of data into the most relevant for that context (time, place, financial situation), while allowing for power users to dig in
• earning our customers' trust, rather than assuming it as a given
• understanding constraints and motivations of consumer psychology, balancing short-term needs and desires with long-term financial wellness
• designing for multiple customers: the individual (B2C) and employer (B2B2C)
• knowing when to design something novel vs. familiar

Mission, Purpose, and Meaningful Work —

We founded Northstar on the belief that every person deserves the best objective, personalized, and affordable financial management. Banks and point solutions are biased, and therefore shouldn’t dictate how we use our money. In the face of overwhelming complexity, most of us do nothing with our money. This leaves 50% of Americans with less than $400 for emergencies, 50% without any retirement savings, and total student debt at over $1.5 trillion.

We founded Northstar to give everyone the full understanding and control of money they deserve. We’re doing this by creating a new default, where your money is automatically allocated with the expertise of a financial advisor, at an attainable and fair price. We hope to change our relationship with money from one of shame and ignorance to confidence and pride.

Everything we do goes hand in hand with our core principles. Money must be:
• Accessible: We make financial best practices and management available to anyone, regardless of income or upbringing.
- Relatable: We’ll always design for how real people think, not how banks think.
• Foundational: We believe in solutions that help you stand on your own two feet, rather than creating reliance on stopgap solutions.
• Aligned: We’ll never profit from our customers’ confusion. We’ll only give recommendations and make decisions that we would give ourselves.

Northstar is an incredibly ambitious vision, and we’re looking forward to seeing how you can join us in striving for these goals.
