title: Hello Paperpile! Let's work together.

whyyou: |
 I believe that **science can make the world a better place**, and I'd love to be help make that work easier for academics and students. I'm looking to work with a small team where I can have a big impact and feel connected to the results. Also, I love your blog and would be thrilled to work on some non-stereotypical stock images of scientists. ðŸ¥¼

 I thrive in a work environment where I can collaborate closely with and learn from others whilst being self-driven. I care a great deal **improving users' experiences**, and I love being able to explore a varied selection of challenges. 

 **I think we'd make a great fit.**

whyme: |

 I've worked on an array of different web and mobile applications, and I have a strong sense of visual design. (Just talk to me about typography for ten minutes!) At the same time, I have a **deep understanding of UI and UX principles** and design solutions that are usable and friendly.  My experience with **user research and product design** means that I approach my work in a user-centric way, always taking into account the entirety of the user experience.

 My background in visual design means I'm well-versed in **aesthetics and branding**, as well as having experience with **animation and illustration**. I aim for a style that feels in line with modern tastes and trends whilst still maintaining its own flair. 

 Iâ€™m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I'm well-versed in **HTML, CSS, and SASS**, as well as being pretty adept in both **vanilla JavaScript and React**.  My broad range of experience across the web means that I'm able to apply a consistent look and feel across a wide range of pages, bringing **cohesion and clarity to the overall experience** whilst still experimenting and trying new things.
