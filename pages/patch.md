title: Hello Patch! Let's change healthcare together.

whyyou: |

 It may sound a bit idealistic, but I'm a big believer in the **power of technology as a tool to improve people's lives**. Healthcare is a market that often isn't as appealing to tech workers as taxis and magical juicers, but I think there's a huge opportunity to innovate in ways that will help make for a more equitable world. I'd like to be a part of that.

 I'd like to help you **make healthcare easier to use**.

Core Skills

  I have **over ten years of visual and product design experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skilfully with development teams.

  This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**, and I'm a natural leader who has experience leading other designers on project work.

  My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as dealing with a range of different types of companies and organisations and navigating the complexities of coordinating work across timezones. Having spent eight years freelancing, I'm extremely **proactive and self-motivated**. There is very little I can't figure out how to do, and I like getting things done.
