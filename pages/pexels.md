title: Hello Pexels! Let's make great things together.

whyyou: |

 **I love Pexels!** I've worked with Pexels' API on a number of different projects, most notably in [integrating Pexels into WordPress.com](https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2018/08/02/diverse-stock-photo-library-pexels/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer"} and also in using the API to automatically populate sites with images for [Rivet](/rivet). Pexels is a great product and I'd be thrilled to help make it even better.

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |
 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.
