title: Hello Respondent! Let's work together.
intro: I’m a big believer in the importance of research to drive design and product decisions. I’ve led a number of different user research initiatives, and I know that one of the most difficult parts of the process is recruiting and scheduling participants. I’m excited by the work Respondent is doing to revolutionise and improve that process, and would love to help drive that forward.
