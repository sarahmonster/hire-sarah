title: Hello Respondent! Let's work together.
jobtitle: product designer
company: Respondent

whyyou: I’m a big believer in the importance of research to drive design and product decisions. I’ve led a number of different user research initiatives, and I know that one of the most difficult parts of the process is recruiting and scheduling participants. I’m excited by the work Respondent is doing to revolutionise and improve that process, and would love to help drive that forward.

whyme: I’m primarily a visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I care deeply about diversity and inclusivity in tech and frequently speak at events across the world. My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
