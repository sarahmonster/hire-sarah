title: Hello RocketAir! Let's make great things together.

whyyou: |
 One of the things I miss most about freelancing is the *ability to work across a wide range of different industries*. I love being able to learn a little about lots of different businesses and absorb some whatevers from that.

 And finally, I like that you're a small team but work on a lot of different projects. I'm happiest when I'm able to contribute a lot and develop a lot of different skills.

 In short: I think we'd make a great fit!

whyme: |
  I have **over ten years of visual and product design experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skilfully with development teams.

  This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**, and I'm a natural leader who has experience leading other designers on project work.

  I tend to act as the voice of the user, but I also take into account business needs and attempt to balance those requirements. My experience getting my hands messy with code means I'm good at directing and communicating with developers and using text and imagery to communicate a concept. On any given day I'll be working on wireframes, user flows, clickable prototypes, and UI designs for web and mobile, amongst an array of other tasks. Sketch and InVision are key components of my toolkit.

  My experience in open-source and freelance work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders and clients, as well as dealing with a range of different types of companies and organisations and navigating the complexities of coordinating work across timezones. Whilst most of my communication is via text, I'm also a practised conference speaker who's comfortable presenting to groups of all sizes.

  Having spent eight years freelancing, I'm extremely **proactive and independent**. I love collaborating with others to accomplish a shared vision, but I'm also comfortable tackling a problem on my own and operating with autonomy.
