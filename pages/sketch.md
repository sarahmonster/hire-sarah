company: Sketch
title: Hello Sketch! Let's work together.

whyyou: |
 I bet you hear this a whole lot from designers, but **I love Sketch**, both as a product and as a brand, and I'd love to be involved with making it even better. I thrive in a work environment where I can collaborate closely with and learn from others whilst being self-driven. I care a great deal about the web and about improving users' experiences, and I love being able to explore a varied selection of challenges. 

 I think we'd make a great fit.

whyme: |
 I've **designed and built hundreds of websites**, starting way back when CSS was just in its infancy, and I have a wide range of skills and knowledge about the medium. I've worked remotely for over ten years and am super comfortable communicating asynchronously as well as synchronously.

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** (this site was built using Jekyll!) and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I'm well-versed in **HTML, CSS, and SASS**, as well as being pretty adept in both **vanilla JavaScript and React**. **Sketch** is an integral part of my workflow, so I'm very familiar with the product and brand. I've done some work on marketing pages in the past and would love to develop my skills here. My broad range of experience across the web means that I'm able to apply a consistent look and feel across a wide range of pages, bringing **cohesion and clarity to the overall experience** whilst still experimenting and trying new things.

 My experience with user research and product design means that I approach my work in a user-centric way, always taking into account the entirety of the user experience.

This is a varied role meaning you’ll be responsible for designing the Sketch website — whether it’s marketing pages, Sketch Cloud, our knowledge base, or web apps like the License Manager, it’ll be your job to make sure our website looks great, feels consistent and always provides the best user experience.

We’re looking for someone who is passionate about the web and above all: we’re looking for a dedicated team player with a keen and meticulous eye for detail.

We value every year of experience in your field, but experience isn’t the be-all and end-all. The ideal candidate has the passion and the knowledge to build high quality software. We’d love for you to learn from us, just like we’d love to be able to learn from you.
