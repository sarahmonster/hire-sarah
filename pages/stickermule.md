title: Hello Sticker Mule! Let's make shiny, stickery things together.

whyyou: |

  I care deeply about customer needs and am always advocating for simple, accessible user experiences online. I love working on public-facing design as much as on internal tooling (employees deserve great design too), so I’m excited by the opportunity to work on both at StickerMule.
  
  Plus, stickers are pretty great. Who doesn't like stickers?


whyme: |
  I have **over ten years of UI/UX design experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. This wide-ranging general knowledge allows me to approach my work in a holistic way and take responsibility for the entirety of the design lifecycle. I'm highly adaptable and capable of contributing at all levels, from **strategy to implementation**.

  I’m primarily a **visual and product designer**, but I have a strong technical background that allows me to interface skillfully with development teams. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React.** I'm extremely comfortable implementing designs, contributing to rapid prototyping, or hacking together ideas in order to test a solution.

  I'm highly experienced with **Sketch, Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InVision**, and I pick up new tools quickly. I'm comfortable prototyping at all levels of fidelity depending on what best suits the project at hand and best communicates a concept. I'm very familiar with responsive design tactics and almost always start by designing mobile-first, as well as considering accessibility requirements from the outset.

  My experience in open-source work has given me excellent communication skills. I'm great at **defending design decisions** and framing decisions for stakeholders. Leading projects and organising work in the open-source space has honed my ability to organise, lead, and present ideas clearly. Most of this work tends to be written, but as a frequent conference speaker, I also have excellent presentation skills.
