 I believe that **privacy is a right that everyone, regardless of technical ability, should be able to access**. Technology is a tool that can be leveraged to make the world a better, fairer, more equitable place. But as technology tracks us more and commodifies our data, that tool serves to benefit corporations, not people.

 **Transparency** is something I value highly, and I love working with people who are passionate about their work and their purpose. I’m a big fan of constructive criticism and would love to work with a team who’ll challenge me to do my best work.

 Oh, and I love that you make **yearly donations** to worthwhile organisations—and that you included Girl Develop It and Freedom of the Press Foundation amongst the recipients.

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely, both with clients and in an open-source context, means I have great written communication skills and can clearly articulate design decisions. My experience leading projects allows me to approach work in a strategic way, defining the vision, roadmap, and success metrics of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I have extensive experience with Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma, Abstract and other design tools, as well as front-end development experience. I approach my work with a mobile-first perspective and have experience adapting designs for different devices. I've done quite a lot of customer interviews and comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution.

 My career has been marked by a continued process of experimentation and innovation, bringing new ideas to every project I join.
