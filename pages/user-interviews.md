title: Hello User Interviews! Let's work together.

whyyou: |

 I care deeply about **solving problems**, and I firmly believe that product teams need to talk to their users to truly understand those problems. It’s why I’ve advocated for research and usability testing across all the products I’ve worked on, and why I’ve spent the last few years **leading others in research efforts**. Recruiting users to talk to can often be a blocker to conducting research, and I’d love to help make that part of the process simpler.

 I’m excited by the prospect of working with a smaller team, where my work will have more impact and visibility. **I’m happiest when I have an opportunity to work on a variety of different challenges**, from higher level strategic work to the perfect line-spacing for maximum legibility.

 Also, and this is just an aside, but you write a delightful job description that made me say “Yes!” ❤️ I think we’d make a great fit.

whyme: |
 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I’ve worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have excellent written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I’m self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for the success of a project.

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work holistically. I often end up coding my designs, and am comfortable working with CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React. My technical skills mean I’m great at communicating and collaborating with developers (although it doesn’t hurt that I live with one as well!) I have extensive experience with **Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma**, and other design tools, as well as experience working with and developing **design systems**.

 I’ve led many user research and usability studies and am skilled at planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution. Most recently, **I led a team of twenty-five in conducting an exploratory research study** as part of the open-source WordPress project, and I’m currently working to set up a toolkit and framework for future research efforts, as well as teaching contributors.

 My experience working in an open source environment means that I’m adept at **diplomatically defending my design decisions, but I’m never dogmatic**, and I’m happy to be proven wrong. I’m not afraid of failure, and I like to share my work as soon as possible for best results.

About the role

-----------------

Look, you’re going to be the first Product Designer on the team. Please only apply if you find that really, truly, especially exciting. Ok, and maybe a little frightening – we’re looking for a cool, vulnerable, and honest human after all.

The good news is that you’ll be joining a team that already cares deeply about talking to our users, creating a great experience for them, and incorporating their feedback into everything we do. But we need someone who can make us even better at those things.

To be honest, our approach to design to date has been patchy. Despite that clumsy approach, our growth has been really strong and users love our product. Suffice to say – we are excited to see what happens when you help us turn our design from a liability into a strength. That’s basically the job in a nutshell.

Plus, you'll be designing a product used by your peers at world class companies. There is a fun-meta-geekiness to the whole thing that never gets old.

General responsibilities

-----------------

I’m not going to bother defining a bunch of responsibilities in detail. You’ll be our leading product design efforts, full stop. The one specific responsibility worth mentioning is creating and maintaining our design system.

Beyond that, we’re a rapidly growing startup that will probably ask you to help with a little bit of everything from time to time. You can expect to talk to users, summarize research, build out wireframes, create prototypes, and so on.

But don’t worry – we’ll work together to carve out clear areas of ownership and autonomy for you. You will report to me, the VP of Product. I’m more concerned about developing an awesome working relationship with you than I am about drawing up some UX vs. Design vs. Product venn diagram about who does what.

I believe, for this to work well, we need to be partners pursuing the same goals. We’ll sort out the specifics together.

Skills & experience

-----------------

The baseline is someone who is smart, motivated, and an awesome teammate. It wouldn’t hurt if you were organized and a systems thinker as well.

2-5 years of UX / Product Design experience. Not too concerned about job titles – more that you’ve spent a good chunk of time designing modern web applications.

Very adept with modern design tools – Sketch, Figma, or whatever it is you like to use.

Proficient understanding of HTML / CSS – you do not need to a be a front-end developer by any means. But we want someone who can converse knowledgeably with developers and account for implementation complexity in their decision making.

Ideal candidate

-----------------

— You love user research and use it to drive your thinking but generate your own ideas as well.

— You enjoy specializing deeply in your craft but like dabbling in other areas from time to time.

— You’re passionate about defending your opinions but enjoy having them challenged by the team.

— You do whatever it takes for the team to succeed but thrive working independently.

— You hold yourself and your work to a high standard but share rough drafts early and often.

About the team

-----------------

We’re a remote team that is on a mission to help other teams discover and embrace user insights. We are proactive about staying close to one another despite not sharing the same physical space. Remote culture is real and we care about it – a lot.

We care a lot about feedback. From our users, of course. But also from each other. We hold company wide retros every month to make sure we’re always improving and everyone has a place to voice their feedback.

We’re a little weird? We’re fun? We’re empathetic? Don’t worry about it too much, there will be plenty of time to get to know us as we get to know you.
