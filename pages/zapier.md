title: Hello Zapier! Let's make people happier!

whyyou: |

I've caught myself lecturing people a lot about "you know, a computer should really be doing that." There are just some things that computers are better at, and we'd all be better off if we let the computers handle it.

I love what Zapier is doing—and you've saves 

 **Let's work together.**

whyme: |

 I have **over ten years of experience**, during which time I've worn many different hats, spanning from research and product management, to visual design and branding, to prototyping and interaction design. My experience working remotely means I have great written communication skills, and my experience leading projects means I'm self-driven and good at defining the goals and measurements for success of a project. 

 I’m primarily a **visual and product designer, but I have a strong technical background** and a wide-ranging general knowledge that allows me to approach my work in a holistic way. I often end up coding my own designs, and am comfortable working with **CSS, HTML, JavaScript , and React**. My technical skills means I'm great at communicating and collaborating with developers (although it doesn't hurt that I live with one as well!) I have extensive experience with Sketch, Invision, Adobe CS, Figma, and other design tools, as well as experience working with and developing design systems. 

 I've also led a number of user research and usability studies and am comfortable planning and leading research studies—as well as pulling out actionable recommendations from all that qualitative data! I embrace a data-informed approach to my work but balance this with intuition in the pursuit of the best solution. Most recently, **I led a team of twenty-five in conducting an exploratory research study as part of the open-source WordPress project**, and I'm currently working to set up a toolkit and framework for future research efforts, as well as teaching contributors.

 My experience working in an open source environment means that I'm adept at **defending my design decisions in a diplomatic way, but I'm never dogmatic** and I'm happy to be proven wrong. I'm not afraid of failure and I like to share my work as soon as possible for best results. 

 Also, I know how to pronounce "Zapier". (I think).
